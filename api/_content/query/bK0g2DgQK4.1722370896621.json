This means that the content of the page is not actually present in the HTML file that is initially sent by the server.

This can be especially useful for web applications that need to display frequently updating data, such as social media feeds or real-time stock tickers."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"client-side-rendering-drawbacks"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Client-side rendering drawbacks"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"However, client-side rendering also has some drawbacks. Because the content is generated by JavaScript, it can take longer for the page to load, as the browser has to download and execute the JavaScript code before it can display the content. This can lead to slower page load times, which can be frustrating for users and may negatively impact search engine rankings. Additionally, because the content is not present in the initial HTML file, it is not visible to search engines, which can make it more difficult for the page to be indexed and rank well in search results."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"server-side-rendering"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Server-Side Rendering"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Server-side rendering (SSR) is a method of rendering web pages in which the server generates the full HTML for a page and sends it to the client as a complete document.

Since search engines rely on server-side rendering to crawl and index web pages, SSR can help ensure that your content is fully discoverable and easily indexed. Additionally, SSR can help improve the accessibility and performance of your site, especially for users with slower internet connections or less powerful devices."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Another advantage of server-side rendering is that it can provide a more consistent user experience across different devices and browsers.
